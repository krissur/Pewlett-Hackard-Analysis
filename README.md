# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
In this analysis I created two additional specific tables of employee information.
The 1st table consists of the number of employees about to retire and their individual titles.
The 2nd table consists of information on employees who qualify for a mentorship program. 

## Results
It is clear when reviewing the data regarding the individuals ready for retirement, that there are many who hold senior positions with the company. I foresee this could be very damaging if preparations are not made in advance.

The second set of information holds the mentorship program information.

## Summary 
My suggestion in preparation for the senior employees’ retirements, would be to run more analysis on those within the company that are capable and prepared to move up and hire within. Moreover, the eligible mentorship employees could be a place to start looking for replacements. Then fill the lower positions with newer less experienced hires.
I believe there is still more data available that could help move people around and prepare for the “Silver Tsunami”.
